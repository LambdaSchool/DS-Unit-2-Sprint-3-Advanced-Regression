    "1. Load, validate, and clean/prepare the data.\n",

    "3. Answer questions based on the results (as well as a few extra questions about the other modules)\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good! Manage your time, and make sure to get to all parts. If you get stuck wrestling with the data, simplify it (if necessary, drop features or rows) so you're able to move on. If you have time at the end, you can go back and try to fix/improve.\n",

Before deriving too many \"insights\" from the data, an initial sanity check can be performed by looking at variables that are commonly known to predict increased income, such as higher education and having a wife. Both of these are correct. Some insights that may be drawn from the data (greater and lower incomes is in reference to fifty k):\n",

    "Quantile Regression: I don't actually think that quantile regression is appropriate here. It's just not appropriate anywhere else. Quantile regression could tell you in which way the features impact the lowest performers, but not predict which observations will be low performers. Quantile regression might be more appropriate for designing an intervention (e.g. we see that the coefficient on feature X is quite large for our lowest performers, so lets design an intervention based around X). \n",
