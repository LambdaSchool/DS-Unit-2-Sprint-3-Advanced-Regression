        "- Yes, Ridge can be applied to classification! Check out [sklearn.linear_model.RidgeClassifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.RidgeClassifier.html#sklearn.linear_model.RidgeClassifier), and try it on a problem you previous approached with a different classifier (note - scikit LogisticRegression also automatically penalizes based on the $L^2$ norm, so the difference won't be as dramatic)\n",
        "- Implement your own function to calculate the full cost that ridge regression is optimizing (the sum of squared residuals + `alpha` times the sum of squared coefficients) - this alone won't fit a model, but you can use it to verify cost of trained models and that the coefficients from the equivalent OLS (without regularization) may have a higher cost"
