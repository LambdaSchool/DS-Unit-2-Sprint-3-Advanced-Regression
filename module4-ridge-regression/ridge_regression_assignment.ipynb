Check out [sklearn.linear_model.RidgeClassifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.RidgeClassifier.html#sklearn.linear_model.RidgeClassifier), and try it on a problem you previous approached with a different classifier (note - scikit LogisticRegression also automatically penalizes based on the $L^2$ norm, so the difference won't be as dramatic)\n",
