        "Then, present results - display coefficients in as interpretible a way as you can (hint - scaling the numeric features will help, as it will at least make coefficients more comparable to each other). If you find it helpful for interpretation, you can also generate predictions for cases (like our 5 year old rich kid on the Titanic) or make visualizations - but the goal is your exploration to be able to answer the question, not any particular plot (i.e. don't worry about polishing it).\n",

Student grade performance: I would try to use a survival analysis to model the student performance over time until \"failure\" which in this case would be falling into a bottom tier of grades. There will be students or observations that have not yet falling below the threshold that would be considered the censored data. The cutoff point would be a certain time point that would be established so we can track the academic indicators up until that point in time. "

        "2. Tech company product launch: I would try to use a ridge regression to help model and predict new product launches for tech companies. The timing of development cycles can be very unpredictable so I would proceed investigating how \"chaotic\" product launches can be. By simply go over historical product launches would not necessarily be indicative because it depends on research and developmant discoveries and market demand. Larger tech companies with mature products have a more predictible timeline of annual product launches but novel products from small to medium sized tech companies would have much larger variance. If we tried to fit a model to each product launch from the data of our universe of tech companies, we could be overfitting the data causing large swings that we could correct with regularization."

        "3. Plant size and yield: I would use a quantile regression that can focus on limited dozens of plants that can be studied at a time. By targeting this particular quantile of total plants that have great physical data, we would be able to better model the expected plant size and yield of this selected species. OLS and looking at the mean would  potentially be less effective because we are unable to look at all the plants in the laboratory. It would depend on the overall goal of the study, but if it was to better understand the best yield we would want to construct a model based on targeted cutoff of plants we could most effectively study and measure.
